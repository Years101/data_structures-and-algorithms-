# Data Structures and Algorithms

## Overview
Welcome to the **Data Structures and Algorithms** repository! This project serves as a collection of fundamental data structures and algorithms implemented in C++ and Python. Each section contains well-documented implementations along with explanations.

## Implemented Data Structures
### 1. Stacks (Array-Based)
- Implementation of a stack using an array.
- Supports basic operations: `push()`, `pop()`, `peek()`, and `isEmpty()`.

### 2. Stacks with Linked List
- A dynamic stack implementation using a linked list.
- Overcomes the limitations of fixed-size arrays.

### 3. Linked List
- Implementation of a singly linked list.
- Supports operations: `insert()`, `delete()`, `search()`, and `display()`.

## Future Additions
- Queues (Array & Linked List)
- Doubly Linked List
- Trees (BST, AVL)
- Graphs (DFS, BFS)
